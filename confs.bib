 Hierarchical data structures such as irregular pyramids are used by
 many applications related to image processing and segmentation. The
 construction scheme of such pyramids is bottom-up. Such a scheme
 forbids the definition of a level according to more global
 information defined at upper levels in the hierarchy. Moreover, the
 base of the pyramid has to encode any single pixel of the initial
 image in order to allow the definition of regions of any shape at
 higher levels. This last constraint raises major issues of memory
 usage and processing costs when irregular pyramids are applied to
 large images. The objective of this paper is to define a top-down
 construction scheme for irregular pyramids. Each level of such a
 pyramid is encoded by a combinatorial map associated to an explicit
 encoding of the geometry and the inclusion relationships of the
 corresponding partition. The resulting structure is a stack of
 finer and finer partitions obtained by successive splitting
 operations and is called a top-down pyramid.

 Processing large images is a common issue in the computer vision
 framework with applications such as satellite or microscopic images.
 The major problem comes from the size of those images that prevents
 them from being loaded globally into memory. Moreover, such images
 contain different information at different levels of resolution. For
 example, global features, such as the delimitation of a tissue,
 appear at low resolution whereas finer details, such as cells, can
 only be distinguished at full resolution. Thus, the objective of
 this paper is the definition of a suitable hierarchical data
 structure that would provide full access to all the properties of
 the image by representing topological information. The idea consists
 in transposing the notion of tile for top-down topological pyramids
 to control accurately the amount of memory required by the
 construction of our model. As a result, this paper defines the
 topological model of tiled top-down pyramid and proposes a
 construction scheme that would not depend on the system memory
 limitations.

 Applicative fields based on the analysis of large images must deal
 with two important problems. First, the size in memory of such
 images usually forbids a global image analysis hereby inducing
 numerous problems for the design of a global image
 partition. Second, due to the high resolution of such images, global
 features only appear at low resolutions and a single resolution
 analysis may loose important information. The tiled top-down
 pyramidal model has been designed to solve this two major
 challenges. This model provides a hierarchical encoding of the image
 at single or multiple resolutions using a top-down construction
 scheme. Moreover, the use of tiles bounds the amount of memory
 required by the model while allowing global image analysis. The main
 limitation of this model is the splitting step used to build one
 additional partition from the above level. Indeed, this step
 requires to temporary refine the split region up to the pixel level
 which entails high memory requirements and processing time. In
 this paper, we propose a new splitting step within the tiled
 top-down pyramidal framework which overcomes the previously
 mentioned limitations.

  Recent microscopic imaging systems such as whole slide scanners
  provide very large (up to 18GB) high resolution images. Such amounts
  of memory raise major issues that prevent usual image representation
  models from being used. Moreover, using such high resolution images,
  global image features, such as tissues, does not clearly appear at
  full resolution. Such images contain thus different hierarchical
  information at different resolutions. This paper presents the model
  of tiled top-down pyramids which provides a framework to handle such
  images. This model encodes a hierarchy of partitions of large images
  defined at different resolutions. We also propose a generic
  construction scheme of such pyramids whose validity is evaluated on
  an histological image application.
