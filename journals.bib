 The uprising number of applications that involve very large
 images with resolutions greater than 30\,000$\times$30\,000
 raises major memory management issues. Firstly, the amount of data usually
 prevents such images from being processed globally and
 therefore, designing a global image partition raises several
 issues. Secondly, a multi-resolution approach is necessary since
 an analysis only based on the highest resolution may miss global
 features revealed at lower resolutions. This paper introduces
 the tiled top-down pyramidal framework which addresses these two
 main constraints. Our model provides a full representation of
 multi-resolution images with both geometrical and topological
 relationships. The advantage of a top-down construction scheme
 is twofold: the focus of attention only refines regions of
 interest which results in a reduction of the amount of required
 memory and in a refinement process that may take into account
 hierarchical features from previous segmentations. Moreover, the
 top-down model is combined with a decomposition in tiles to
 provide an accurate memory bounding while allowing global
 analysis of large images.
